# synqc-temporal-dynamics-series-hybrid-controller
This repo has been used to test and prove a working prototype hybrid traffic controller/accelerator. Everything you need is here for local testing and real hardware runs but I recommend you build your own web MVP UI as the one provided here would be for personal use only on your local machine and its quoite complex. Tools you want to have: Git Bash, Docker, Redis and Grafana. Utilizes Prometheus web scraping. I have provided 5 built and tested Docker artifacts for you to test. Build directions for sandbox Agents.  Have fun and be responsible.
